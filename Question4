ACME_MARIADB_PASSWORD
- The container file should have environment variables as below
  MARIADB_DATABASE
  MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD
- The environment variables should use the build arguments as below 
  MARIADB_DATABASE uses ACME_MARIADB_DATABASE
  MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD uses ACME_MARIADB_PASSWORD
- Use these build arguments and should fetch its value from the user at build  
  ACME_MARIADB_DATABASE=acme
  ACME_MARIADB_PASSWORD=acme
- The image must be locally available and tag as acme:5000/acme-mariadb:latest
- Push the image to registry as acme:5000/acme-mariadb:latest

# SOLUTION TASK 1 on acme-db

- Go into the working directory: cd /home/student/workspace/acme-mariadb-db
- Create/Edit the containerfile: vi acme-mariadb-containerfile

  FROM mariadb:latest

  ARG ACME_MARIADB_DATABASE
  ARG ACME_MARIADB_PASSWORD

  ENV MARIADB_DATABASE=${ACME_MARIADB_DATABASE}
  ENV MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=${ACME_MARIADB_PASSWORD}

- Build and Tag the image with the arguements:
  podman build -t acme:5000/acme-mariadb:latest \
  -f acme-mariadb-containerfile \
  --build-arg ACME_MARIADB_DATABASE=acme \
  --build-arg ACME_MARIADB_PASSWORD=acme  .

- Confirm and Verify the built image: podman images | grep acme-mariadb
- Push the image to the registry: podman push acme:5000/acme-mariadb:latest


# SOLUTION TASK 2 on acme-db-exporter
- Go into the working directory: cd /home/student/workspace/acme-mariadb-db
- Confirm the Bash script exists and has executable permissions: ls -lR
    # You should see: -rwxr-xr-x export.sh
  And if it doesnt have executable permissions, add this is the containerfile, 
  after the WORKDIR argument --> RUN chmod +x export.sh

- Create/Edit the containerfile: vi acme-db-export-containerfile
  
  FROM mariadb:latest
  COPY scripts/export.sh /scripts
  WORKDIR /scripts
  CMD ["./export.sh"]

- Build and Tag the image:
  podman build -t acme:5000/acme-mariadb-export:latest -f acme-db-export-containerfile .

- Confirm and Verify the built image: podman images | grep acme-mariadb-export
- Push the image to the registry: podman push acme:5000/acme-mariadb-export:latest
